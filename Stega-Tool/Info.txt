Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, 
apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message.
Steganography, in general, relies on the imperfection of the human auditory and visual systems.

Stega-Tool is a software which implements steganography using image (.png) files.
This software can hide message files inside a image file by using the Least Significant Bit Algorithm.
